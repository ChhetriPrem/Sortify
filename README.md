# **SortFlow – The Beauty of Algorithms in Motion**  

### **📌 Why This Exists**  
Sorting isn’t just about arranging numbers—it’s about understanding **logic, efficiency, and problem-solving.**  
Ever wondered **how computers think?** How they **organize chaos** in milliseconds?  

SortFlow is more than a tool; it’s an **experience**—a way to see, feel, and understand the **soul of algorithms.**

### **🚀 What You Can Do Here**  
✅ **Watch Algorithms Come to Life** – See sorting algorithms **visually** in action.  
✅ **Compare Efficiency** – Watch which algorithm wins in speed and performance.  
✅ **Control the Flow** – Adjust speed, array size, and even step through each process.  

Sorting is no longer just code—it’s a **visual symphony of logic and movement.**  

---

### **⚡️ Why This Matters**  
**Because understanding algorithms should be intuitive, not intimidating.**  
**Because learning should be fun, not frustrating.**  
**Because seeing is believing.**  

And because, in the end, coding isn’t just about syntax—it’s about **seeing the invisible patterns** behind everything.  

Welcome to Sortify.  
Let’s make learning **beautiful.** 💙
